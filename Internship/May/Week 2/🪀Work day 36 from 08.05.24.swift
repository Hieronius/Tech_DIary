MARK: - Tasks:

1. Fix problem with building the project ‚úÖ
2. Build project on real device
3. Make sure that when user taps a calendar cell it's choose a right one (not day - 1) ‚úÖ
4. Put delegate method of body calendar collection view to Controller and just pass data about selected cell to work with
5. Make sure the format of tapped day is the same as we use inside the app
6. If you ignore onboarding and reload the app you won't see any names in MainScreen on the top scrolling view, so i should prevent interrapting of onboarding process
7. self.appSettingsStorage.launchedBefore = true in Budget.Router probably should be placed on ResultViewController, because User might just close an app before settings a budget and participants.
