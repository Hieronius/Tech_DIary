MARK: - Tasks:

1. Make sure selected day will always appear when you call and dismiss the calendar ‚úÖ
2. Separate Day generation process from CalendarController to it's own file ‚úÖ
3. Add MARK comments to DayGenerator
4. If you ignore onboarding and reload the app you won't see any names in MainScreen on the top scrolling view, so i should prevent interrapting of onboarding process
5. self.appSettingsStorage.launchedBefore = true in Budget.Router probably should be placed on ResultViewController, because User might just close an app before settings a budget and participants.


MARK: - Optional:

1. ResultOnboardingViewController.swift - if !self.participants.contains(where: {$0.name == contact.name}) { ... } (watch your pull request for more)
2. Fix the problem of continue button being active even if we remove all contacts when we go from MainController



MARK: - Questions to ask:

1. Can i feel Redme of the app with short explanation of project structure?
2. Can we use Readme inside the project for our own needs?
