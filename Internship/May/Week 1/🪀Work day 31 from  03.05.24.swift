MARK: - Tasks:

1. Make onboarding screen as first screen when you run an app ‚úÖ
2. Connect onboarding screen with FirstEntryScreen ‚úÖ
3. Connect ResultScreen with MainScreen on TabBar
4. Connect FirstEntryScreen with MainScreen if User won't give permission to use his contacts
5. Research router and understand how to use it ‚úÖ
6. Check and set Router so when user runs app at the first time it will display onboarding and next time - main screen on TabBar ‚úÖ
7. check and set so participants bar on MainScreen will be dispayed accordingly to ResultViewController
8. Fix slide bar on MainScreenVC
9. Fix all NavigationViewControllers on the app (if there is a back button on design - make it)
