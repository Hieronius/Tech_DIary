MARK: - Tasks:

1. Connect MainScreen with ContactsScreen to get and fetch contacts (Access to Contacts should be inside FirstEntryScreen) ‚úÖ
2. If you ignore onboarding and reload the app you won't see any names in MainScreen on the top scrolling view, so i should prevent interrapting of onboarding process
3. self.appSettingsStorage.launchedBefore = true in Budget.Router probably should be placed on ResultViewController, because User might just close an app before settings a budget and participants.
4. Remove unused code from Budget.OnboardingScreen and Budget.MainScreen ‚úÖ


MARK: - Optional:

ResultOnboardingViewController.swift - if !self.participants.contains(where: {$0.name == contact.name}) { ... } (watch your pull request for more)


MARK: - Questions to ask:

1. If user still didn't set his name and participants should we really launch the MainScreen if he launch app a second time? ‚úÖ
2. How to run BudgetApp without access to AppleDeveloper profile with notifications?
3. Find the way to get code from BudgetApp to my work laptop so i can inspect this code much easier ‚úÖ
4. Can i feel Redme of the app with short explanation of project structure?
5. Can we use Readme inside the project for our own needs?

Ask it in online meeting with team
