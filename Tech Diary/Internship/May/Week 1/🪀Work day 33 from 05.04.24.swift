MARK: - Tasks:

1. Connect MainScreen with ContactsScreen to get and fetch contacts (Access to Contacts should be inside FirstEntryScreen)
2. If you ignore onboarding and reload the app you won't see any names in MainScreen on the top scrolling view, so i should prevent interrapting of onboarding process
3. Add button "save" in ContactsScreen when we go here from MainScreen ‚úÖ
4. Remove button "add operation" when user trying to achieve Notifications or ContactsScreen ‚úÖ
5. add check of getting access to user's Contacts when User trying to get Contacts first time from MainScreen ‚úÖ
6. self.appSettingsStorage.launchedBefore = true in Budget.Router probably should be placed on ResultViewController, because User might just close an app before settings a budget and participants.
7. Remove unused code from Budget.OnboardingScreen and Budget.MainScreen


MARK: - Optional:


MARK: - Questions to ask:

1. If user still didn't set his name and participants should we really launch the MainScreen if he launch app a second time?
2. How to run BudgetApp without access to AppleDeveloper profile with notifications?
3. Find the way to get code from BudgetApp to my work laptop so i can inspect this code much easier
4. Can i feel Redme of the app with short explanation of project structure?
5. Can we use Readme inside the project for our own needs?
