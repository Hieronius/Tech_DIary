MARK: - Tasks:

1. Make sure that when user taps a calendar cell it's choose a right one (not day - 1)
2. Put delegate method of body calendar collection view to Controller and just pass data about selected cell to work with
3. Make sure the format of tapped day is the same as we use inside the app
4. If you ignore onboarding and reload the app you won't see any names in MainScreen on the top scrolling view, so i should prevent interrapting of onboarding process
5. self.appSettingsStorage.launchedBefore = true in Budget.Router probably should be placed on ResultViewController, because User might just close an app before settings a budget and participants.


MARK: - Optional:

ResultOnboardingViewController.swift - if !self.participants.contains(where: {$0.name == contact.name}) { ... } (watch your pull request for more)


MARK: - Questions to ask:

1. How to run BudgetApp without access to AppleDeveloper profile with notifications?
2. Can i feel Redme of the app with short explanation of project structure?
3. Can we use Readme inside the project for our own needs?
